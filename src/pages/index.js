              We&apos;re working on an alternative content creation platform.
              Built from the ground up with a focus on <em>transparency</em>,{' '}
              <em>accountability</em>, and <em>community support</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&apos;s a huge risk to jump into this industry, but we firmly
              believe there needs to be an alternative out there. One that
              doesn't take money from venture capitalists. One that isn&apos;t
              ad-supported. One that makes clear how you can support the
              platform, and doesn&apos;t take anything away when you choose to
              support a creator.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe in us, come support and follow our development.
              We&apos;ll give you a look behind the curtain as we progress.
